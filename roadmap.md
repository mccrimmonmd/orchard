# Roadmap

## Essential

- Trees take multiple turns to grow; winner is determined based on owner of
line-making tree
- Larger board(s)
- Online multiplayer (asynchronous)

## Likely

- Expand board when full (instead of a draw)
- Scoring system instead of immediate win (Go- or Othello-esque)
  - Possible end conditions: set number of turns (limited seeds?), filling the
  board (no expansion), mutual pass
    - Maybe you get more seeds when you score points? Or seeds *are* points? So
    then the first person to run out of seeds loses!
- More than two plant types
- Support for more than two players
- Online matchmaking ('rooms' instead of users? can join public spaces under any
name, but private spaces require password? (but then, no way to publicly track
stuff like wins/losses, leaderboards, etc...which might not be a bad thing?))
- Terrain

## Speculative

- Map editor
- Actions other than planting (fire? rain?)
