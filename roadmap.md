# Roadmap

## Essential

- Trees take multiple turns to grow; winner is determined based on owner of
line-making tree
- Larger board(s)

## Likely

- Expand board when full (instead of a draw)
- Scoring system instead of immediate win (Go- or Othello-esque)
  - Possible end conditions: set number of turns (limited seeds?), filling the
  board (no expansion), mutual pass
    - Maybe you get more seeds when you score points? Or seeds *are* points? So
    then the first person to run out of seeds loses!
- More than two plant types
- Support for more than two players
- Stuff

## Nice to have
